First you start by inputing the integer x you want checked 
Create some variable i starting at 2
Inside of a while i < x // 2:
  the i variable will be used to modulus the main number to see if the result is 0
  if the result is 0 then we know that it can't be a prime number because x divided by the number i has no remainder
    then exit() returning not a prime number
  increase i by 1
If it makes it to the end of the while loop then it is indeed prime
